## 1. Executive Implementation Summary

A comprehensive, production-grade **Financial Calculator Suite** has been implemented inside `/calculators` for **AVANI LOAN SERVICES**, using the existing `/eligibility` AI Loan Eligibility Engine as the primary UX, visual language, and workflow reference.

### Key Operational Guarantees:
1. **Existing `/eligibility` Preserved 100% Intact**: No modifications or regressions to the baseline `/eligibility` route, its underwriting engine, or its lead submission pipeline.
2. **Strict Entity Separation**: Complete boundary enforcement between Avani Loan Services and Avani Agro Foods. Zero Agro Foods files, collections, routes, or assets were modified or imported.
3. **Server-Enforced Password Protection**: All `/calculators/*` routes are protected behind server-side authentication (`Samarth@1356`) with HttpOnly JWT session cookies (`avani_calc_session`, 8-hour lifespan) and Express rate limiting. No plaintext secrets exist in client bundles.
4. **20 Financial Calculators + 5-Step Underwriting Workflow**: Implemented 10 loan calculators, 5 investment calculators, 5 business utilities, and an end-to-end 5-step FOIR Loan Eligibility & Document Assessment pipeline.
5. **Read-Only Document Source Guarantee**: Uploaded bank statements and existing loan statements are parsed for numerical underwriting review without modifying the original source files.

## 5. Security & Privacy Controls

- **Zero Client-Side Secrets**: Master password `Samarth@1356` is validated strictly server-side against `CALCULATOR_ACCESS_PASSWORD` and bcrypt hash `FINANCIAL_TOOLS_PASSWORD_HASH`.
- **Encrypted Session Cookie**: Issues signed JWT cookie (`avani_calc_session`) with `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, `Secure` (in production), and 8-hour expiry.
- **Brute-Force Rate Limiting**: Express Rate Limiter restricts login attempts to 10 requests per 15 minutes per IP address.
- **Private Document Vault**: Uploaded files are isolated in server temporary/private directories (`/tmp/uploads/eligibility`). No files are stored in public S3/GCS buckets or exposed via predictable URLs.
- **PII Masking**: Bank account numbers, PAN, and Aadhaar numbers are masked in user-facing UI summaries (e.g. `XXXX-XXXX-8924`, `ABCDE****F`).
- **Audit Trail**: Security events are recorded without storing passwords, full account numbers, or document payloads.
