## 🔗 Zoho CRM Integration

### Current Setup
- All lead forms submit via `fetch()` (no-cors) to the Zoho Connected Workflow URL
- On form success → WhatsApp pre-filled message auto-opens to `+91-7249108474`
- Fields captured: **Name, Mobile, Email, Loan Type, Loan Amount, City**

### To Finalize Zoho Webforms Integration
1. Log in to Zoho CRM → **Settings → Webforms**
2. Create a new Webform with fields: Name, Mobile, Email, Loan Type, Amount, City
3. Copy the **Form Action URL** (looks like `https://crm.zoho.in/crm/WebToLeadForm`)
4. Open the file:
   ```
   src/components/LeadForm.jsx  (Line 4)
   ```
5. Replace:
   ```js
   const ZOHO_URL = 'https://crmplus.zoho.in/...';
   ```
   With your Webform Action URL, then:
   ```powershell
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: Zoho Webform URL updated"
   git push
   ```
6. Vercel auto-deploys in ~60 seconds ✅

### Zoho Auto-Workflow (Recommended)
- Set up a **Zoho Flow** triggered on new Lead creation
- Action: Send WhatsApp template message to lead's mobile
- Notification: Push to your Zoho CRM mobile app

---

## 💬 WhatsApp Integration

- **FAB Button**: Green WhatsApp icon fixed at bottom-right on every page
- **Link**: `https://wa.me/917249108474?text=Hello! I'm interested in a loan...`
- **Form Fallback**: On every form submit, a WhatsApp tab opens with pre-filled lead details
